<p>Individual scores inside a matrix are plotted in height units; a time slider allows the user to view the "landscape" at
any particular point in time.</p>
<p>The dimensional plotting allows us to examine the data by volume as well as score and accomodates fluctuating volume
naturally. A triptych underneath displays contribution by dimensional subsets of the data.</p>
