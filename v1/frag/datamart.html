  <p>I was asked to revitalize an internal reporting tool that was on its final legs in a last ditch effort to save it from the brink.</p>
  <p>The result was DataMart, a systems reporting aggregator that tied together disparate ERP, CRM, and SFA data into a single, unified view.
It was wildly successful and is now the defacto account management tool -- there is even a training program behind it. One of my favorites!</p>
