      <br />Our goal is to build a high performance culture...</li>
  <li class="EXPANDED" style="display:none;"><em>Business Drivers:</em>
      <br />I meet with the Vice President of Human Resources and the Leadership Team in November
of 2007, they expressed a desire to create a more results oriented culture and identify future
leaders, increase goal alignment and visibility, accountability, career development and link pay to
performance.  Franciscan Health was challenged with increasing turnover, low morale and job
burn-out, pending "baby boomer" succession and leadership gaps, and inability to support a growth
strategy.</li>

  <li class="COMPRESSED"><em>Why SuccessFactors:</em>
      <br />Our global capabilities were also key...</li>
  <li class="EXPANDED" style="display:none;"><em>Why SuccessFactors:</em>
      <br />SuccessFactors invested in developing key FHS Executive partnerships and working them
through a process for changing the culture, in the end, we gained FHS' trust and confidence.  When Halogen was dropping prices, slinging our S-1 financials, sending "goon" squad to Tacoma and "try it and pay later" tactics, SF was creating vision with the Executives on changing the culture and helping achieve Baldrige Award and Magnet Status. SuccessFactors demonstrated an understanding of the healthcare industry, HC wins/references and guiding the FHS through the process of requirements, selection, justification and implementation. </li>

  <li class="EXPANDED" style="display:none;"><em>What this means:</em>
      <br />Franciscan Health is a major affiliate of Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI), based in Denver, Colorado
with over 50,000; say it again with me ... 50,000 employees.  Franciscan Health is the pilot to win the rest of the enterprise in 2008.  Advancing our objective of world domination and control.</li>
