<p>
Dear Shareholders,
I am proud of the performance of our entire team in 2006 in delivering
double-digit earnings growth while at the same time strengthening
Wachovia's future prospects. Wachovia's earnings rose 17 percent from
2005 to $7.8 billion, and earnings per share rose 11 percent to $4.63.
These results include the addition of Golden West Financial on October 1,
2006, and Westcorp on March 1, 2006.</p>

<div id="execmessage-more" style="display:none;">
<p>We achieved these results despite the impact of the inverted yield curve, which squeezed
industry profit margins and caused our net interest income growth to be lower than
we'd expected. But we benefitted from robust fee income and stellar credit quality, and
delivered the bottom line we'd expected when we presented our 2006 outlook to
investors in January a year ago.</p>
<p>I am disappointed, however, that our shareholders were not rewarded in 2006 with a
higher share price commensurate with the quality and strength of our financial results.
Our stock price underperformance was primarily due to the market's reluctance to
embrace our acquisition of Golden West. We believe this reluctance largely stemmed
from short-term concerns over the perceived difficulty of combining our business models
and fears of a weakening mortgage market. While these will be challenges in 2007, we
considered them thoroughly when we evaluated this acquisition. We concluded that the
extraordinary opportunity to leverage Golden West's lending model across our entire
marketplace and to gain important retail locations in fast-growing western states provided
significant opportunities that outweighed any short-term concerns surrounding the weak
mortgage market.</p>

<h4>Expanding the Possibilities</h4>
<p>With our expansion into California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas and other states,
we're leapfrogging ahead in our plans to build new branch offices, and we're establishing
a beachhead to build our commercial, small business and wealth clientele. We have long
said we do not need to be in all 50 states; instead, we have been strategically focused on
expanding into fast-growing markets, and our western expansion clearly supports this
strategy. California alone represents 13 percent of the nation's gross domestic product
and the Far West is one of the fastest-growing regions in the nation.</p>
