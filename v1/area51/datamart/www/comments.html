The press almost chocked when they had to admit Dr Paul raised $2.4M last quarter. I can't wait to see the spin Vannity and ORLY try to put on the cold, hard fact of $4,000,000 more cash money in Ron's campaign war chest. The total $7 million will wake up a lot of Americans. I'd like to see Ross Perot style infomercials!
