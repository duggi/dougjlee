<p>Hello, Doug here. Thanks for visiting!</p>


<p>I'm a designer and technologist in the Bay Area. I've been around
from startup to enterprise, back, and forward again.</p>

<p>In a previous life I
worked in the games biz, as an artist, animator, and producer/director.</p>

<p>My typical role is early stage, working with a core team to define and shape product experience.
Product development is my passion; innovation and execution my weapons.</p>

<p>This site is an exploration and a showcase. For this revision I've gone extra
fancy with the HTML5, AJAX, and non-linear experience. Kick the
tires and give it a whirl, then reach me on the "Contact" tab. I'd love to
hear from you.</p>
